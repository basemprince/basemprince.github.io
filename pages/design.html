        <p>At Global Drain Technologies, production relied mainly on sheet metal and welding. The following list encapsulates the production methods and equipment I worked with during my employment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sheet Metal Stainless Steel grades, gauges, their properties and corrosion resistance</li>
          <li>Laser Cutting Machines</li>
          <li>Metal Press Brakes, Metal Rollers and Metal Forming</li>
          <li>Tig and Mig Welding</li>
          <li>Weld or Electrochemical Cleaning Systems</li>
          <li>Sand Blasters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I studied sheet metal forming basics and methods, researched Press Brake tooling fundamentals and tolerances, and learned about the capabilities of the equipment and dies owned by the company.</p>
        <p>Using Autodesk Inventor, I created sheet metal models and generated and modified sheet metal flat patterns with both AutoCad and Inventor. I also gained experience with an in-house industrial laser cutting machine and associated nesting software.</p>
        <p>I worked closely with the welders on the production floor, gaining experience in Stainless Steel welding and designing sheet metal layouts that were easy to weld. I became familiar with electrochemical cleaning systems such as Surfox machines, and used sand blasting with glass beads as media to achieve the required surface finish according to food safety standards.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The Food Industry often deals with a problem where employees dump the waste caught in basket strainers into drain outlets, leading to blockages in their plumbing systems. A simple solution was needed to discourage this behavior.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Global Drain Technologies offers an optional secondary strainer that prevents any waste from going down the drain.</li>
          <li>The optional strainer needed to be corrosion resistant, easy to remove, sanitary, and waterproof with no possible harbouring points.</li>
          <li>The solution for easy removal was implemented in the form of a lock that can be released using a magnetic key.</li>
          <li>Researched, discussed with university professors and tested multiple metals that met the following requirements:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>High corrosion resistance</li>
            <li>Possessed magnetic properties</li>
            <li>Could be machined without special equipment</li>
            <li>Were easily obtainable and reasonably priced</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Tested Austenitic, Martensitic, and Ferritic types of Stainless steel in salt water to confirm their corrosion resistance capabilities.</li>
          <li>Conducted numerous tests with variations of the components with the help of prototyping with a 3D printer.</li>
          <li>Found a combination of a magnet and a metal that worked together.</li>
          <li>Researched O-ring standards and test fitted different sizes to find an appropriate option for the pin and hole sizes. I later dimensioned the correct grove size based on the standard to get correct sealing.</li>
          <li>Contacted CNC machining service providers for quotes once a working prototype was achieved.</li>
          <li>Designed a key for the lock that was easy to manufacture, simple, food safe, and aesthetically pleasing. Outsourced the magnet required for the key from an online vendor and confirmed its capabilities before committing to a large order.</li>

            Slot Drain Tab-less Design
          </h5>
        </div>
        <p>Typically, all slot drains have welded tabs in their slots to maintain the slot width and shape during transportation and installation. However, these tabs can create sanitary problems as they form harbouring points and pose challenges during cleaning.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To eliminate the need for the tabs, I designed rib-like structures to replace them and tested them using Inventor stress analysis.</li>
          <li>Various configurations of the ribs were tested using Inventor's stress analysis with the help of the parametric table tool.</li>
          <li>The parametric table allows for testing multiple constraints simultaneously to optimize for a specific target.</li>
          <li>The target was to only allow for a specific amount of displacement at the neck of the slot drain, with the least amount of material required.</li>
          <li>I set upper and lower limits to the constraints, then used the stress analysis study to check every possible combination of the constraints values to find and optimize for the best solution.</li>
          <li>To decrease the material required to manufacture the ribs, I used the frame generator feature of Inventor. This feature removes material from the ribs that do not contribute to the function of the model as they experience little to no stress.</li>
          <li>The best rib design was then used in another simulation to find the needed amount of ribs to install on a single slot drain run.</li>
          <li>I created drawings and DXF files for the sheet metal components to get it ready for production. The ribs were then produced and welded on a slot drain for real life testing.</li>

The jigs must be simple, easy to use, reliable, and capable of reproducing consistent results.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The jigs served to increase the speed of production, and improve the consistency between products and batches.</li>
          <li>Designing the jigs involved the help and feedback of the production team as they are the ones who will use them.</li>
          <li>I received requests and built specific tools or jigs that the welders thought could improve the production process.</li>
          <li>I spent many hours on the production floor with the production team to understand their actual needs.</li>
          <li>The jigs were mainly made from laser cut sheet metal welded together, and others were 3D printed.</li>

          <li>A team project to design a stand alone system that would be integrated onto a combine header for Macdon that required little to no modifications to the header</li>
          <li>Took the project through the engineering design process, from define phase through problem statement and objectives</li>
          <li>Defined target specifications through customer needs and created a project metrics list, constraints and limitations, then a project schedule with a Gantt Chart</li>
          <li>Generated concepts through brain storming sessions then used advantages/disadvantages list and weighing matrix for the criteria then using the criteria to score the concepts</li>
          <li>Chose the concept, performed calculations and dimensioning of the components, then created a BOM for the system</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The class included three design projects the involved producing a solution for a problem with a specific set of parameters and limits</li>
          <li>The first project required the design of a structure that would be able to support a force and achieve a minimal structure weight</li>
          <li>The second project required the design of a shaft that needs to transmit torsional power and that won't fail due to yielding, fatigue, or fracture before a specific amount of cycles</li>
          <li>The third project involved the development of a transmission system for a windmill. Three possible power transmission systems were considered: a belt drive, chain drive, and gear drive. The gear drive was selected and a complete transmission system was developed along with the shaft, keys, seals, retainer rings, ball bearings, and lubrication requirements, etc.</li>
          <li>During the projects, Apmonitor and Matlab were used to solve and iterate for the best combination of parameters to achieve the least weight</li>
          <li>Used SolidWorks to render the designed systems and perform FEA analysis and calculate factors of safety</li>
          <li>Produced detailed and comprehensive reports for each project. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13KXOWFrXLFb2jho6bAA_n5iPpP5YfJJO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a></li>

          <ul>
            <li>Created completely custom name tags for friends and family members</li>
            <li>Used Autodesk Inventor to create the name tags, with the help of Autodesk Meshmixer for modifying the mesh for the STL files</li>
            <li>Meshmixer was also used to generate and separate complexes to prepare the models for dual extrusion 3D printing</li>
            <li>Used OpenSCAD to generate a planetary gear assembly that can be fully 3D printed all at once</li>
            <li>Prototyped multiple models to get the correct tolerance between the gears and account for the capability of the 3D printer to achieve a model that can rotate with little effort</li>
            <li>Used anatomically correct teeth models to create a dental articulator assembly. Then modified the mesh, sliced, and dual extrusion 3D printed it</li>
