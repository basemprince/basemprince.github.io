								<ul >
									<li>The main objective of the project was to design and manufacture an autonomous vehicle powered by Arduino that can navigate a course and fire projectiles at targets</li>
									<li>Using knowledge gained in computer aided design, along with background knowledge of design, an autonomous Arduino powered car was able to be produced</Li>
									<Li>The vehicle and all of its external components were designed using Solidworks. The additional components required to meet the objective of launching a projectile to a target from the track were manufactured using rapid prototyping (3D printing), laser cutting, and CNC machining</li>
									<Li>The track was designed such that the vehicle required an array of line sensors and bump sensors to successfully navigate it</Li>
									<Li>Navigation was based around skid steering, utilizing line sensors mounted to the front of the vehicle and bump sensors on the sides of the vehicle</Li>
									<Li>In order to hit the targets, a spring powered rack and pinion launcher was designed, using a continuous hobby servo (for pulling back the rack) and one position control hobby servo (for a rotary magazine/carousel to load BB’s)</Li>
									<Li>The launcher was placed on a moveable platform to adjust trajectory. A gear reduction was used to maintain torque when pulling the firing piston (rack) back. The loading mechanism utilized the position control servo to rotate carousel magazine, dropping one BB into the chamber at a time. The magazine was designed with a capacity of six BB’s and to automatically reset itself</Li>
									<Li>In order to detect the brass rods on the track indicating launch positions, the bump sensors were mounted on the side of the vehicle using 3D printed brackets</Li>

									<li>The second project required the design of a shaft that needs to transmit torsional power and that won't fail due to yielding, fatigue, or fracture before a specific amount of cycles</li>
									<li>The third project involved the development of a transmission system for a windmill. Three possible power transmission systems were considered: a belt drive, chain drive, and gear drive. The gear drive was selected and a complete transmission system was developed along with the shaft, keys, seals, retainer rings, ball bearings, and lubrication requirements, etc.</li>
									<li>During the projects, Apmonitor and Matlab were used to solve and iterate for the best combination of parameters to achieve the least weight</li>

							<ul >
							<Li>The ham line on the cut floor cannot keep up when the boneless demand is 100% of production. Initial complaint from the production team mentioned that the ham tumbler is not performing properly
								<Li>Performed analysis on the tumbler by timing the rate of entry of hams into the tumbler and comparing it to the rate of ejection. I performed retention time studies and how long do hams stay inside the tumbler on average to verify that its meeting our requirement. After performing statistical analysis on the tumbler's capability of delivering hams within our plant production speed, it was concluded that ham delivery to the tumbler was the main source of variation</Li>
								<Li>Looked at drawings for the ham tumbler and discovered that it's angle is not set properly on the production floor. I contacted the equipment supplier, who sent a technician to modify and set it's angle correctly. the modification improved the tumbler's capability of purging at end of production</Li>
								<Li>Studied the line through performing time study analysis and cycle times for the various processes and the skinner station showed as the bottleneck</Li>
								<Li>I created a cause and effect diagram and 5 why's to drill down for the root cause of the bottle neck at the skinner station. The conclusion was that the skinner operators spend extended times handling the product to and from the skinner station, which furthermore introduced fatigue</Li>
								<Li>Examined videos of the skinner station on the old cut floor and compared cycle times that showed that the ham ejection after skinning was the biggest bottle neck on the new cut floor</Li>
								<Li>Used the cycle times of the old production floor which showed that 2 skinner stations is not sufficient with our new cut floor speed</Li>
								<Li>Wrote test protocols to try out solutions with the current designs which still didn't eliminate the problem completely</Li>
								<Li>Used Autocad Inventor to create designs and layouts for the skinner stations to improve product flow</Li>
