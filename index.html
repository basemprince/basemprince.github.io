								<ul >
									<li>The main objective of the project was to design and manufacture an autonomous vehicle powered by Arduino that can navigate a course and fire projectiles at targets</li>
									<li>Using knowledge gained in computer aided design, along with background knowledge of design, an autonomous Arduino powered car was able to be produced</Li>
									<Li>The vehicle and all of its external components were designed using Solidworks. The additional components required to meet the objective of launching a projectile to a target from the track were manufactured using rapid prototyping (3D printing), laser cutting, and CNC machining</li>
									<Li>The track was designed such that the vehicle required an array of line sensors and bump sensors to successfully navigate it</Li>
									<Li>Navigation was based around skid steering, utilizing line sensors mounted to the front of the vehicle and bump sensors on the sides of the vehicle</Li>
									<Li>In order to hit the targets, a spring powered rack and pinion launcher was designed, using a continuous hobby servo (for pulling back the rack) and one position control hobby servo (for a rotary magazine/carousel to load BB’s)</Li>
									<Li>The launcher was placed on a moveable platform to adjust trajectory. A gear reduction was used to maintain torque when pulling the firing piston (rack) back. The loading mechanism utilized the position control servo to rotate carousel magazine, dropping one BB into the chamber at a time. The magazine was designed with a capacity of six BB’s and to automatically reset itself</Li>
									<Li>In order to detect the brass rods on the track indicating launch positions, the bump sensors were mounted on the side of the vehicle using 3D printed brackets</Li>

									<li>The class included three design projects the involoved producing a solution for a problem with a specific set of parameters and limits</li>
									<li>The first project required the design of a structure that would be able to support a force and achieve a minimal structure weight</li>
									<li>The second project required the design of a shaft that needs to transmit torsional power and that won't fail due to yielding, fatigue, or fracture before a specific amount of cycles</li>
									<li>The third project involved the development of a transmission system for a windmill. Three possible power transmission systems were considered: a belt drive, chain drive, and gear drive. The gear drive was selected and a complete transmission system was developed along with the shaft, keys, seals, retainer rings, ball bearings, and lubrication requirements, etc.</li>
									<li>During the projects, Apmonitor and Matlab were used to solve and iterate for the best combination of parameters to achieve the least weight</li>
									<li>Used SolidWorks to render the designed systems and perform FEA analysis and calculate factors of safety</li>

									<Li>Was chosen to be a part of the team that represented the university of Manitoba for innovative design in the Western Engineering Competition [WEC]</Li>
									<Li>Designed and presented an automated solution for cleaning the oceans from micro-plastics</Li>									
									<Li>One of the areas that suffer the most from garbage disposal are the oceans, which now hosts 5.25trillion pieces of plastic debris. This translates to about 269000 tones of floating plastic waste on thesurface of the oceans</Li>
									<Li>The UV radiations cause the large plastic objects to fragment into even smaller piecesthat are called micro-plastics. Micro-plastics are not just harder to extract, but also more harmful forthe small creatures that form the base of the marine food web</Li>
									<Li>To help aid in the cleaning efforts, a drone wouldbe a very helpful and effective way of tackling this problem. The drone is automated and could be de-ployed to look for and collect the micro-plastics floating on top of the ocean</Li>
									<Li>The drone has a storage unit on board, which when filled, returns to a base to empty what it has collected</Li>
									<Li>This drone does notneed human interference as it can do its job autonomously and go back to its base when its either fullor need to charge</Li>
									<Li>The affordable designed drone featured a torpedo shape body frame, floaters to maintain sea level, renewable energy power source, autonomously controlled, and could provide real time data</Li>
									<Li>Designed bases to host the drone, drop collected waste, clean the filter and to charge if needed. The bases could be 100 km's appart</Li>
									<Li>The bases consist of a swiveland a sliding mechanism to grab and hoist the drone in position. They also include a filter extractor to open the drone front cover, move the filter out to clean it and drop the caught micro-plastics into a storage tank. The bases have an on board tracking system, batteries and solar panels</Li>

							<ul >
							<Li>The ham line on the cut floor cannot keep up when the boneless demand is 100% of production. Initial complaint from the production team mentioned that the ham tumbler is not performing properly
							<Li>Performed analysis on the tumbler by timing the rate of entry of hams into the tumbler and comparing it to the rate of ejection. I performed retention time studies and how long do hams stay inside the tumbler on average to verify that its meeting our requirement. After performing statistical analysis on the tumbler's capability of delivering hams within our plant production speed, it was concluded that ham delivery to the tumbler was the main source of variation</Li>
							<Li>Looked at drawings for the ham tumbler and discovered that it's angle is not set properly on the production floor. I contacted the equipment supplier, who sent a technician to modify and set it's angle correctly. the modification improved the tumbler's capability of purging at end of production</Li>
							<Li>Studied the line through performing time study analysis and cycle times for the various processes and the skinner station showed as the bottleneck</Li>
							<Li>I created a cause and effect diagram and 5 why's to drill down for the root cause of the bottle neck at the skinner station. The conclusion was that the skinner operators spend extended times handling the product to and from the skinner station, which furthermore introduced fatigue</Li>
							<Li>Examined videos of the skinner station on the old cut floor and compared cycle times that showed that the ham ejection after skinning was the biggest bottle neck on the new cut floor</Li>
							<Li>Used the cycle times of the old production floor which showed that 2 skinner stations is not sufficient with our new cut floor speed</Li>
							<Li>Wrote test protocols to try out solutions with the current designs which still didn't eliminate the problem completely</Li>
							<Li>Used Autocad Inventor to create designs and layouts for the skinner stations to improve product flow</Li>
							<Li>Shared and communicated all my findings with the design engineer from the equipment supplier company to help with the redesign of the ham line</Li></ul>

							<Li>The objective of the project is to eliminate the occurrence of product back up at the exit of the Flowvac, which would remove the need for having a personnel there</Li>
							<Li>I performed 5 Why's analysis and cycle time studies to prove the two main root causes of the problem, which are, the Flowvac and Cryovac speeds are not in sync, and distance between products are not consistent</Li>
							<Li>Measured the dimensions of the space on the production floor to use as limits for the conveyor redesigns</Li>
							<Li>I came up with different solutions for each root cause and used javascript coding to simulate current condition and compare it with the implementation of the solutions</Li>
							<Li>Presented the solutions to the maintenance supervisor and team and agreed on the PLC logic reprogramming</Li>
							<Li>Designed and wrote a new logic for the PLC controlling the dual infeed conveyor. The PLC would use proximity sensors to keep track of empty spaces between products and only merge when there is enough space</Li></ul>

								<li>All slot drains have welded tabs in their slots to maintain the slot width and shape during the transportaion and installation process</Li>
								<li>The tabs could be later removed by the clinet, however, it could be a difficult task to accomplish</Li>
								<li>Tabs create harboring points, which could be unsanitary. It also creates challenges during the cleaning process</Li>
								<li>To eleminate the need for the tabs, rib like structures were designed and tested using Inventor stress analysis</Li>
								<Li>Various configurations of the ribs were tested using Inventor's stress anlaysis with the help of the parametric table</Li>
								<Li>The parametric table allows for testing multiple constraints simultainously to optimize for a specific target</Li>
								<Li>The target was to only allow for a specific amount of displacement at the neck of the slot drain, with the least amount of material required</Li>
								<Li>Once the chosen constraints were given lower and upper limits, the stress analysis study checked every possible combination of the constraints values to find the best solution</Li>
								<Li>To decrease the material required to manufacture the ribs, the frame generator feature of Inventor was used. This feature removes material from the ribs that do not contribute to the function of the model as they do not experince stress</Li>
								<Li>The best rib design was then used in another simulation to find the needed amount of ribs to install on a single slot drain run</Li>
								<Li>The ribs were then produced and welded on a slot drain for real life testing</Li>

								<Li>Online reviews play an increasing role in business. In the digital world they have replaced the word of mouth. With all the benefits it brings, unfortunately fake reviews produced by bots falsify this data</Li>
								<Li>The purpose of this work is to further facilitate the prevention of deceptive text from decreasing thecredibility of online reviews</Li>
								<Li>This is done by developing a machine learning model to identify deceptive reviews that is simple enough to produce a better performance than a given existing solution without sacrificing accuracy</Li>
								<Li>The project used quantitative techniques to classify review data-sets as deceptive or genuine. Once the ML algorithm was developed, an analytical method was used to quantify the performanceand accuracy. This was later compared to the approach of using the combination of genuine and deceptive reviews in order to confirm or to invalidate the stated hypothesis</Li>
								<Li>The data-sets were gathered, cleaned up and merged into one table using R studio and Pandas. The data was then pre-processed before feeding it into the SVM algorithms</Li>
								<Li>Extensive pre-processing was required through Natural Language Processing (NLP).This is essential to enable the computer to interpret the human language. The following five steps were performed to transform the review text into a form that can be fed into the algorithm:</Li>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<Li><b>Tokenization:</b> To break a block of text into a list of words</Li>
									<Li><b>Remove Stop words and Non-alpha text:</b> Stop words such as (a, at, but, etc) and numbers are irrelevantand can create over-fitting issues. Therefore, they are removed from the text</Li>
									<Li><b>Word Lemmatization:</b> To group together all forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item.For an example, change, changing, and changer</Li>
									<Li><b>Word Vectorization:</b> It is a general process of turning a collection of text documents into numericalfeature vectors. The method used is called TF-ID. The method summarizes how often a word appears,and down scales words that have a high frequency across all documents, which in return highlightsmore interesting words</Li>
									<Li><b>Undersampling:</b> To eliminate imbalance from the data-sets, undersampling removes samples from themajority class until all labels are equally represented</Li>
								</ul>

								<li>The name of the startup venture is “Ebike Amp”. The startup is a new electric bike product that offers solutions for everyday commuting, or as a recreational/competitive sport</Li>
								<Li>The bike has both pedaling and electric assist capabilities that would allow the driver to either get a comfortable and easy commute, or a hard workout if needed</Li>
								<Li>Furthermore, the bike also can offer the driver a shield against the weather whether it’s raining, snowing, or just plain windy</Li>
								<Li>The idea was generated due to a personal interest. I really enjoy biking and have been into it for many years</Li>
								<Li>I started getting into biking as a hobby at the beginning, However, since I arrived in Sweden, it is my way of commuting as well. Multiple variables made biking here a lot more difficult than what I am used to, which in return made it unsustainable</Li>
								<Li>I also have a great interest in automation, and an electronic bike was the perfect combination between the two interests, biking and automation</Li>
								<Li>The concept of the ebike went through three iterations. The first iteration was a two-wheel ebike that looked very similar to current ebikes on the market, these forms of ebikes do not offer any form of protection against the environment</Li>
								<Li>I wanted the ebike to easily offer the capability of transforming into a stationary bike, which currently no ebike manufacturers offer. Furthermore, I wanted to offer the capability of putting back power into the grid from pedaling while using the ebike in the stationary mode</Li>
								<Li>With some research, I discovered that if you pedaled eight hours every day for 30 days (no weekends off), then doing the math, you'd generate about 16 kWh. A typical house in the U.S. uses about 1,000 kWh a month, which means with all that pedaling, would be able to save about 0.16% of your electric bill. With these results, putting power back to the grid is completely unsustainable and not worth going after</Li>
								<Li>The second iteration was to create a bike that would use one wheel instead of two. However, that proved difficult to combine both stability and the possibility of pedaling while riding. While a one-wheel ebike would be more efficient and might be easier to weatherproof, it will also be very uncomfortable and harder to control. Furthermore, it’s a lot more complicated to stabilize</Li>
								<Li>The third iteration was to put the driver inside the one wheel and provide means of assistance with balancing and turning. This iteration also made it possible to add weather protection without compromising the ebike dimensions, as it will be still enclosed within the wheel</Li>
								<Li>The product is still in the concept phase, which means no prototype has been created nor tested</Li>
								<Li>The Ebike Amp has innovative features that tackle multiple challenges when it comes to using bikes for commuting. The innovative solutions were developed for the following challenges:</Li>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<Li><b>The roads have too many hills:</b> The Ebike Amp has an electric motor/generator to assist in pedaling. The user can have two options to choose how much assisting is required. The first option would be a torque multiplier, so as an example, the user can choose to multiply their torque input from pedaling by 1.5X. The second option is choosing the maximum torque applied by the user to the pedals. This option will make the pedal have a constant feel even if you are going on ramps or hills</Li>
									<Li><b>Difficulty turning with one wheel:</b> The Ebike Amp has electric motor/generators to assist in turning. The electric motors can control the two wheels to turn the bike. By slowing down the left wheel, and speeding up the right, the bike will turn left, and vice versa. The turn assist can also be used in regenerative breaking to transform breaking energy into charging the batteries. The turn assist frame can also swing upwards to reduce friction and increase efficiency when the bike is traveling in higher speeds</Li>
									<Li><b>Un-versatile:</b> the Ebike Amp can be also used as a stationary bike. If the user would like to train at home. The bike can be used as a stationary bike without any modifications. With just a press of a button, the motor used in assisting in pedaling can turn into a generator. That means if the bike is in stationary mode, the user can charge the ebike’s batteries. The turn assist frame would make sure the bike is standing up at all times</Li>
									<Li><b>Not enough range in the batteries:</b> The Ebike Amp has a large dome on the top that can host a large solar panel. A flexible solar panel can be installed on the dome to use solar energy to constantly charge the batteries. The Ebike Amp will also offer hot swappable batteries that can be changed in seconds</Li>
