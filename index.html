					<ul style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
						<li>The main objective of the project was to design and manufacture an autonomous vehicle powered by Arduino that can navigate a course and fire projectiles at targets</li>
						<Li>The vehicle and all of its external components were designed using SolidWorks. The additional components required to meet the objective of launching a projectile to a target from the track were manufactured using rapid prototyping (3D printing), laser cutting, and CNC machining</li>
						<Li>The track was designed such that the vehicle required an array of line sensors and bump sensors to successfully navigate it</Li>
						<Li>Navigation was based around skid steering, utilizing line sensors mounted to the front of the vehicle and bump sensors on the sides of the vehicle</Li>
						<Li>In order to hit the targets, a spring powered rack and pinion launcher was designed, using a continuous servo (for pulling back the rack) and one position control servo (for a rotary magazine/carousel to load BBs)</Li>
						<Li>The launcher was placed on a movable platform to adjust trajectory. A gear reduction was used to maintain torque when pulling the firing piston (rack) back. The loading mechanism utilized the position control servo to rotate the carousel magazine, dropping one BB into the chamber at a time. The magazine was designed with a capacity of six BB’s and to automatically reset itself</Li>
						<Li>In order to detect the brass rods on the track indicating launch positions, the bump sensors were mounted on the side of the vehicle using 3D printed brackets</Li>
						<Li>A PID controller was employed to keep the car in the middle of the track</Li>

						<Li>Was chosen to be a part of the team that represented the university of Manitoba for innovative design in the Western Engineering Competition [WEC]</Li>
						<Li>Designed and presented an automated solution for cleaning the oceans from micro-plastics</Li>									
						<Li>One of the areas that suffer the most from garbage disposal are the oceans, which now hosts 5.25trillion pieces of plastic debris. This translates to about 269000 tones of floating plastic waste on the surface of the oceans</Li>
						<Li>The UV radiations cause the large plastic objects to fragment into even smaller pieces that are called micro-plastics. Micro-plastics are not just harder to extract, but also more harmful for the small creatures that form the base of the marine food web</Li>
						<Li>To help aid in the cleaning efforts, a drone would be a very helpful and effective way of tackling this problem. The drone is automated and could be de-ployed to look for and collect the micro-plastics floating on top of the ocean</Li>
						<Li>The drone has a storage unit on board, which when filled, returns to a base to empty what it has collected</Li>
						<Li>This drone does not need human interference as it can do its job autonomously and go back to its base when its either full or need to charge</Li>
						<Li>The affordable designed drone featured a torpedo shape body frame, floaters to maintain sea level, renewable energy power source, autonomously controlled, and could provide real time data</Li>
						<Li>Designed bases to host the drone, drop collected waste, clean the filter and to charge if needed. The bases could be 100 km's apart</Li>
						<Li>The bases consist of a swivel and a sliding mechanism to grab and hoist the drone in position. They also include a filter extractor to open the drone front cover, move the filter out to clean it and drop the caught micro-plastics into a storage tank. The bases have an on board tracking system, batteries and solar panels</Li>

					<ul >
						<Li>The project's objective is to evacuate three robots from a room in which a number of obstacles are present</Li>
						<Li>Evacuation must be as fast as possible without colliding with any walls, obstacles or with each other</Li>
						<Li>The robot's initial positions, the location of the gate, and the number/ location of obstacles are random</Li>
						<li>Written entirely in C++ and used Robot Operating System(ROS)</Li>
						<Li>The solution is based on constructing a roadmap using the vertical cell decomposition algorithm</Li>
						<Li>The path for each robot is then found by using breadth first search and later optimized to remove any redundant movements</Li>
						<Li>Once we find all paths for the robots, we recursively check for collision detection between the robot paths and adjust them accordingly</Li>
						<Li>The optimization is done by looking ahead to the future. Each point on the path is allowed to look at the upcoming points (up to a defined limit). It compares the distances between itself and each point that is on the horizon. The smallest distance will decide which point we will jump to next [given that no collision has been detected]</Li>
						<Li>The function uses a tunable cost discount that could encourage going for further away points [in the index] even though they are not the least distance</Li>
						<Li>The look ahead that decides the horizon is a variable that is controlled by the algorithm. It starts greedily with the full horizon, then later restricts it to allow for an increase in the distance of the path</Li>
						<Li>As shown in the figure below, that increase in the length is done when a collision has been detected on that path to maybe allow for more time for the other robot to clear the collision point</Li>

						<li>A Gazebo simulation of a TIAGo robot localizing in a previously mapped apartment</Li>
						<Li>The robot has several onboard sensors and a manipulator which enable it to navigate and interact with the environment through simple manipulation tasks</Li>
						<Li>The robot has modules for path planning, control, localization, sensing, and manipulation</Li>
						<Li>The main mission is to navigate to a specific location to pick up an object, then transport it to a different target location</Li>
						<Li>We made use of the available sensors and actuator through the software packages provided to accomplish the goal</Li>
						<Li>The simulation uses Robot Operating System (ROS)</Li>
						<Li>In the localization step, the robot spins around to gather as much information as possible from the environment using the sensors</Li>
						<Li>Localization is done by using a particle filter. Random distribution of poses of the robot gets scattered across the map, then each one of them gets evaluated to find out how likely it is the true pose</Li>
						<Li>The least likely ones get deleted, and the most likely ones are used to generate poses nearby in a reiterative manner to find out the correct pose</Li>
						<Li>ARUCO markers were used to find the cube's pose. Once the robot can see the marker, it can target its location with the manipulator</Li>
						<Li>State Machine and Behavior Tree were both used as models for the robot's behavior</Li>
						<Li>The robot has the capability to recognize when it is kidnapped, and re-localizes when it occurs</Li>

						<Li>The hardware is a Zed stereo camera and a Velodyne VLP-16 with an Nvidia Xavier as a GPU. The Driver-less pipeline uses Robot Operating System (ROS)</Li>
						<Li>The Zed camera input is fed into YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a real-time object detection CNN</Li>
						<Li>The YOLO algorithm detects the cones and outputs the color of the cone and the bounding box points locations</Li>
						<Li>The point cloud output from the Lidar was used to get the correct distance to the cones and had to be transformed to the camera image frame</Li>
						<Li>To compute the transformation, the intrinsic and the extrinsic matrices had to be calculated first</Li>
						<Li>The intrinsic and the extrinsic matrices were calculated using Matlab's camera calibration tool box</Li>
						<Li>After the point cloud was transformed to camera frame, the bounding boxes from YOLO were used to filter out the transformed point cloud</Li>

						<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)">GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANs) AND FEDERATED LEARNING</h2>
						<ul>
						<li>My master's thesis project involved implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using non-i.i.d. time-series data in a Federated Learning setting</li>
						<li>The thesis was conducted at Scania CV AB, a renowned provider of commercial vehicles</li>
						<li>The project focused on generating synthetic data for a specific system on Scania's vehicles, called the Air Processing System (APS). APS is responsible for supplying
							air pressure to multiple subsystems on the vehicle</li>
						<li>Collecting anomalous data manually from vehicles is an expensive and risky process, requiring intentional introduction of failure and many hours of driving</li>
						<li>Several image-based state-of-the-art strategies were considered, compared based on relevant criteria, and required limitations. The most effective strategy 
							was identified and implemented in decentralized learning, based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics</li>
						<li>A CNN architecture was implemented for the discriminator and generator, with various mutations tested. A nine-layer architecture for both networks proved 
							to be the most effective configuration. However, this approach also poses a significant challenge in terms of physical implementation due to the increased number 
							of layers potentially surpassing the computational capabilities of edge devices</li>
						<li>An LSTM-based auto-regression model was developed to help evaluate the time-series based output. Two methods, TSTR and TRTS, were used to train and test the model, 
							and three metrics were calculated: R2 score, MAE, and RMSE. This evaluation proved useful but was not always definitive, especially for decentralization, as the 
							GAN output is a mix of the distribution of the workers</li>
						<li>Potential improvements and areas for further research include experimenting with LSTM-based architectures, comparing them to the CNN-based approach used in this
							 study. Additionally, investigating other methods, such as diffusion models and transformer networks instead of GANs for data generation, would be valuable, as they 
							 have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in this field</li>

					<li>Two neural networks were created using TensorFlow and Keras:</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						<li>The first neural network is the main Q-value function (Q) that we aim to minimize using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</li>
						<li>The second neural network is the Target Q-value function (Q-hat) and is used as a target for (Q)</li>
						<li>The weights of (Q-hat) remain constant for a much more extended number of iterations</li>
						<li>Without this feature, the algorithm would become unstable because the target we are trying to reach is constantly moving</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The performance of the algorithm relies on a considerable amount of hyperparameters, which were experimented with and optimized</li>
					<li>An (ε) greedy policy with an exponential decay was used. The probability (ε) starts at 1, which promotes extensive exploration at the beginning</li>
					<li>The algorithm starts the exploitation process towards later episodes and acts greedily towards reducing cost</li>
					<li>Utilized a replay buffer that holds a certain number of observations. Old observations get replaced with new ones once it's full</li>
					<li>A sample is taken from the buffer randomly to use it in training the Q-value function neural network. This is to create more independent data points</li>
					<li>The model is stored every number of iterations because there is a chance that the algorithm may diverge</li>

					<!-- DECEPTIVE REVIEWS DETECTION THROUGH ONE-CLASS SVM RESEARCH -->
					<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)">DECEPTIVE REVIEWS DETECTION THROUGH ONE-CLASS SVM RESEARCH</h2>

					<ul>
					<li>The project evaluated the performance of using One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect online deceptive reviews</li>
					<li>The hypothesis is that using only genuine reviews is enough to detect deceptive reviews, which reduces data and time required for training and inference</li>
					<li>A One-Class SVM is an unsupervised learning approach, usually used for detecting anomalies in datasets. The algorithm is trained on the normal data, then figures out the boundaries and can classify other points that lie outside that boundary</li>
					<li>Multiple datasets were gathered, cleaned up, and merged into one table using R studio and Pandas. Some preliminary statistical analyses were conducted as follows:</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						<li>As expected, deceptive reviews on average contain fewer words compared to genuine reviews</li>
						<li>Users who wrote fewer reviews mostly give a rating of 4, with low variance</li>
						<li>Users with more reviews start to diverge in their ratings, and the average rating slowly decreases as the number of reviews written by a user increases</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Extensive pre-processing was done through Natural Language Processing (NLP). The following five steps were performed to transform text into a form that can be fed into the neural network:</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						<li><b>Tokenization:</b> To break a block of text into a list of words</li>
						<li><b>Remove Stop words and Non-alpha text:</b> Stop words such as (a, at, but, etc.) and numbers are irrelevant and can create overfitting issues. Therefore, they are removed from the text</li>
						<li><b>Word Lemmatization:</b> To group together all forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. For example, change, changing, and changer</li>
						<li><b>Word Vectorization:</b> It is a general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. The method used is called TF-IDF. The method summarizes how often a word appears and down scales words that have a high frequency across all documents, which in return highlights more interesting words</li>
						<li><b>Undersampling:</b> To eliminate imbalance from the datasets, under-sampling removes samples from the majority class until all labels are equally represented</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Results of the research:
						<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						<li>One-class SVM lacks performance compared to multi-class. The diverse review content made it difficult to detect outliers</li>
						<li>Confirmed that using linguistic features are not enough to detect real-life fake reviews</li>
						<li>One-Class showed great improvement on the time elapsed metric. Poses as a great candidate for quick fake post detection</li>
						<li>One-class SVM could be deployed on a user review level. Performing the training and prediction on the spot could be capable of detecting if a user is posting in an unusual manner or not within their behavior</li>

					<ul >
					<Li>The ham line on the cut floor cannot keep up when the boneless demand is 100% of production. Initial complaint from the production team mentioned that the ham tumbler is not performing properly
					<Li>Performed analysis on the tumbler by timing the rate of entry of hams into the tumbler and comparing it to the rate of ejection. I performed retention time studies and how long do hams stay inside the tumbler on average to verify that its meeting our requirement. After performing statistical analysis on the tumbler's capability of delivering hams within our plant production speed, it was concluded that ham delivery to the tumbler was the main source of variation</Li>
					<Li>Looked at drawings for the ham tumbler and discovered that it's angle is not set properly on the production floor. I contacted the equipment supplier, who sent a technician to modify and set it's angle correctly. the modification improved the tumbler's capability of purging at end of production</Li>
					<Li>Studied the line through performing time study analysis and cycle times for the various processes and the skinner station showed as the bottleneck</Li>
					<Li>I created a cause and effect diagram and 5 why's to drill down for the root cause of the bottle neck at the skinner station. The conclusion was that the skinner operators spend extended times handling the product to and from the skinner station, which furthermore introduced fatigue</Li>
					<Li>Examined videos of the skinner station on the old cut floor and compared cycle times that showed that the ham ejection after skinning was the biggest bottle neck on the new cut floor</Li>
					<Li>Used the cycle times of the old production floor which showed that 2 skinner stations is not sufficient with our new cut floor speed</Li>
					<Li>Wrote test protocols to try out solutions with the current designs which still didn't eliminate the problem completely</Li>
					<Li>Used AutoCad Inventor to create designs and layouts for the skinner stations to improve product flow</Li>
					<Li>Shared and communicated all my findings with the design engineer from the equipment supplier company to help with the redesign of the ham line</Li></ul>

					<Li>The solutions were put on a value vs effort graph to target the gems and the low hanging fruit categories</Li>
					<Li>Created a detailed rework area current process flow along with cycle time for each step</Li>
					<Li>The team used the value stream map and cycle times to eliminate all non-added value steps</Li>
					<Li>I measured all dimensions of equipment and used AutoCad to create an accurate current layout of rework area</Li>
					<Li>The team brainstormed different layouts of equipment and used a spaghetti diagrams to show the most efficient layout</Li>

					<Li>Started with measuring the impact of the floor waste. I collected all the trimmings on the catch pan and all underneath the conveyor and weighed the waste multiple times across 2 days. the calculated average was 16500 CAD $/year loss</Li>
					<Li>Consulted with the maintenance team to get feed back and price out different solutions</Li>
					<Li>Checked the loin line blue prints and found that this specific conveyor was designed to take away a different kind of product than what we are currently using it for, which is the reason why it is creating high floor waste</Li>
					<Li>I contacted the equipment supplier and got a quote for a rotary scrapper for that conveyor. I got the approval from the maintenance supervisor and got a purchase order</Li></ul>

						<li>The Food Industry encounters a problem with employees dumping the waste caught in the basket strainers of their drains into the drain outlet causing plugs down their plumbing systems</li>
						<Li>A simple solution had to be implemented to discourage employees from carrying out that behavior</Li>
						<Li>Global Drain Technologies offers an optional secondary strainer that prevents any waste from going down the drain</Li>
						<Li>The optional strainer has to be corrosion resistant, easy to remove, sanitary, and waterproof with no possibility of harbouring points</Li>
						<Li>The easy to remove part was implemented in the form of a lock that can be released using a magnetic key</Li>

					<ul >
						<li>All slot drains have welded tabs in their slots to maintain the slot width and shape during the transportation and installation process</Li>
						<li>The tabs could be later removed by the client, however, it could be a difficult task to accomplish</Li>
						<li>Tabs create harbouring points, which could be unsanitary. It also creates challenges during the cleaning process</Li>
						<li>To eliminate the need for the tabs, I designed rib like structures to replace them, then I tested them using Inventor stress analysis</Li>
						<Li>Various configurations of the ribs were tested using Inventor's stress analysis with the help of the parametric table tool</Li>
						<Li>The parametric table allows for testing multiple constraints simultaneously to optimize for a specific target</Li>
						<Li>The target was to only allow for a specific amount of displacement at the neck of the slot drain, with the least amount of material required</Li>
						<Li>I chose upper and lower limits to the constraints, then used the the stress analysis study to check every possible combination of the constraints values to find and optimize for the best solution</Li>
						<Li>To decrease the material required to manufacture the ribs, the frame generator feature of Inventor was used. This feature removes material from the ribs that do not contribute to the function of the model as they experience little to no stress</Li>
						<Li>The best rib design was then used in another simulation to find the needed amount of ribs to install on a single slot drain run</Li>
						<Li>I created drawings and DXF files for the sheet metal components to get it ready for production. The ribs were then produced and welded on a slot drain for real life testing</Li>

						<Li>With the help of the welders, I designed and created multiple jigs for each production step to increase speed and consistency</Li>
						<Li>Encountered manufacturing limitations from the spinning service supplier. The supplier found out that the thick gauge stainless steel starts cracking due to the extreme high stress required to form the drain</Li>
						<Li>After consulting all the stakeholders, adjustments were done on the design by reducing the height of the drain as per the service supplier recommendations</Li>
						<Li>The shorter drain posed new challenges to fitting the internal parts: primary, optional strainers, and the magnetic lock</Li>
						<Li>The primary strainer was redesigned to have space for the lock, while still keeping it possible to manufacture in house given our production capabilities</Li>
						<Li>The manufactured prototypes were used to close a large deal with a major Canadian food producer after implementing solutions to their proposed unique problems</Li>
						<Li>Implemented a solution for stopping the cover from rotating to prevent slipping</Li>

					<ul >
					<Li>The objective of the project is to eliminate the occurrence of product back up at the exit of the Flowvac, which would remove the need for having a personnel there</Li>
					<Li>I performed 5 Why's analysis and cycle time studies to prove the two main root causes of the problem, which are, the Flowvac and Cryovac speeds are not in sync, and distance between products are not consistent</Li>
					<Li>Measured the dimensions of the space on the production floor to use as limits for the conveyor redesigns</Li>
					<Li>I came up with different solutions for each root cause and used javascript coding to simulate current condition and compare it with the implementation of the solutions</Li>
					<Li>Presented the solutions to the maintenance supervisor and team and agreed on the PLC logic reprogramming</Li>
					<Li>Designed and wrote a new logic for the PLC controlling the dual infeed conveyor. The PLC would use proximity sensors to keep track of empty spaces between products and only merge when there is enough space</Li></ul>

					<!-- HAM LINE TUMBLER/SKINNER STATION -->
					<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)" >HAM LINE TUMBLER/SKINNER STATION</h2>
					
					<ul >
					<Li>The ham line on the cut floor cannot keep up when the boneless demand is 100% of production. Initial complaint from the production team mentioned that the ham tumbler is not performing properly
					<Li>Performed analysis on the tumbler by timing the rate of entry of hams into the tumbler and comparing it to the rate of ejection. I performed retention time studies and how long do hams stay inside the tumbler on average to verify that its meeting our requirement. After performing statistical analysis on the tumbler's capability of delivering hams within our plant production speed, it was concluded that ham delivery to the tumbler was the main source of variation</Li>
					<Li>Looked at drawings for the ham tumbler and discovered that it's angle is not set properly on the production floor. I contacted the equipment supplier, who sent a technician to modify and set it's angle correctly. the modification improved the tumbler's capability of purging at end of production</Li>
					<Li>Studied the line through performing time study analysis and cycle times for the various processes and the skinner station showed as the bottleneck</Li>
					<Li>I created a cause and effect diagram and 5 why's to drill down for the root cause of the bottle neck at the skinner station. The conclusion was that the skinner operators spend extended times handling the product to and from the skinner station, which furthermore introduced fatigue</Li>
					<Li>Examined videos of the skinner station on the old cut floor and compared cycle times that showed that the ham ejection after skinning was the biggest bottle neck on the new cut floor</Li>
					<Li>Used the cycle times of the old production floor which showed that 2 skinner stations is not sufficient with our new cut floor speed</Li>
					<Li>Wrote test protocols to try out solutions with the current designs which still didn't eliminate the problem completely</Li>
					<Li>Used AutoCad Inventor to create designs and layouts for the skinner stations to improve product flow</Li>
					<Li>Shared and communicated all my findings with the design engineer from the equipment supplier company to help with the redesign of the ham line</Li></ul>

					<ul >
						<li>At Hylife, countless hours were spent to gather data about production performance, which was a huge non-added value</li>						
						<li>To speed up and automate the process, I set up excel sheets that have the capabilities to streamline data entry and save them in tables with the help of Macros</li>
						<li>I set up SQL queries that do complex data calculations from different sources to automatically put together meaningful reports to track the Feed division performance</li>
						<li>These reports include monitoring the micron levels of the ground ingredients, daily production performance in terms of tonnes per hour for the different processes in the Feed Mill, down times, tonnes ordered and delivered, and feed forecasting accuracy</li>
						<li>I used the ASABE S413 (Procedure for Establishing Volumetric Capacities of Cylindrical Grain Bins) to learn about the right factors to use to calculate accurate capacities of bins and the right compaction factor based on the type of bin and grain</Li>
						<Li>I set up an excel sheet that is connected to the company's server (using SQL) to grab actual averages of our own daily tests for the received grains bushel weights to calculate the most accurate tonnes capacity from volume</Li>

					<Li>The solutions were put on a value vs effort graph to target the gems and the low hanging fruit categories</Li>
					<Li>Created a detailed rework area current process flow along with cycle time for each step</Li>
					<Li>The team used the value stream map and cycle times to eliminate all non-added value steps</Li>
					<Li>I measured all dimensions of equipment and used AutoCad to create an accurate current layout of rework area</Li>
					<Li>The team brainstormed different layouts of equipment and used a spaghetti diagrams to show the most efficient layout</Li>
					<Li>The new layout reduced the space required to 41% of previous layout and the result of the Kaizen reduced the cycle time from 60 seconds to 40 seconds per box</Li>
					<Li>Helped the team present the results to higher management</Li>
					<Li>Designed a new multi-purpose table using AutoCad Inventor to serve as a table top to process rework boxes, a box shelf that can hold up to 135 boxes and a bag holding rack. The design was given to the maintenance team for fabrication</Li></ul>

					<!-- SHEET METAL DESIGN AND PRODUCTION EQUIPMENTS -->
					<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)" >SHEET METAL DESIGN AND PRODUCTION</h2>
					<ul >
						<li>At Global Drain Technologies, production relies mainly on sheet metal and welding. The following are production methods and equipment I worked with during my employment:</li>
						<ul style="list-style-type:square">
							<Li>Sheet Metal Stainless Steel grades, gauges, and their properties and corrosion resistance</Li>
							<Li>Laser Cutting Machines</Li>
							<Li>Metal Press Brakes, Metal Rollers and Metal Forming</Li>
							<Li>Tig and Mig Welding</Li>
							<Li>Weld or Electrochemical Cleaning Systems</Li>
							<Li>Sand Blasters</Li>
							</ul>
						<Li>Studied sheet metal forming basics and methods such as bend radius, bend allowance, material thickness, mold point, and setback</Li>
						<Li>Researched Press Brake tooling fundamentals and tolerances. Learnt about the capabilities of the equipment and dies the company currently owns</Li>
						<Li>Used Autodesk Inventor to create sheet metal models, and used both AutoCad and Inventor to generate and modify sheet metal flat patterns</Li>
						<Li>The company has an industrial in house laser cutting machine. Learnt how to use the laser nesting software controlling the laser and its parameters for each metal type, grade and gauge</Li>
						<Li>Worked very closely with the welders on the production floor and gained experience in Stainless Steel welding, and how to create sheet metal designs that are easy to weld</Li>
						<Li>Became familiar with electrochemical cleaning systems such as Surfox machines. It removes oxidation and creates a durable chromium oxide passive layer. The process makes stainless steel both aesthetically pleasing and resistant to corrosion</Li>
						<Li>Used Sand blasting with glass beads as media to achieve the required surface finish as per food safety standards</Li>

					<ul style="margin-bottom: 250px;">
						<li>I was responsible for researching, designing, and introducing a new product to the company's catalog</Li>
						<li>Done an extensive research on what are the customer's needs and what are the current competitor solutions on the market</Li>
						<Li>Reviewed and summarized the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) specifications to guarantee that the designs follow their strict guidelines for food safe standards</Li>
						<Li>Created a list of customer needs and designed different solution prototypes and 3D printed them</Li>
						<Li>The area drain product included multiple sub products that completed the assembly. Some of these are standard, others are optional</Li>
						<Li>The sub products included the main spun or drawn body, the area drain cover, a primary and a secondary strainer, and a magnetic lock mechanism</Li>
						<Li>Presented all my findings and prototypes to stake holders including management, production, engineers, and company owners</Li>
						<Li>After A preliminary design was chosen, I started contacting metal spinning, and deep drawing companies to request quotes</Li>
						<Li>Did a site visit to the company with the most suitable quote to verify their production quality and capability</Li>
						<Li>Kept a record of progress on the tasks required for each part of the product, and updated the team on a weekly bases</Li>
						<Li>With the help of the welders, I designed and created multiple jigs for each production step to increase speed and consistency</Li>
						<Li>Encountered manufacturing limitations from the spinning service supplier. The supplier found out that the thick gauge stainless steel starts cracking due to the extreme high stress required to form the drain</Li>
						<Li>After consulting all the stakeholders, adjustments were done on the design by reducing the height of the drain as per the service supplier recommendations</Li>
						<Li>The shorter drain posed new challenges to fitting the internal parts: primary, optional strainers, and the magnetic lock</Li>
						<Li>The primary strainer was redesigned to have space for the lock, while still keeping it possible to manufacture in house given our production capabilities</Li>
						<Li>The manufactured prototypes were used to close a large deal with a major Canadian food producer after implementing solutions to their proposed unique problems</Li>
						<Li>Implemented a solution for stoping the cover from rotating to prevent slipping</Li>

					<ul style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
						<li>The Food Industry encounters a problem with employees dumping the waste caught in the basket strainers of their drains into the drain outlet causing plugs down their plumbing systems</li>
						<Li>A simple solution had to be implemented to discourage employees from carrying out that behavior</Li>
						<Li>Global Drain Technologies offers an optional secondary strainer that prevents any waste from going down the drain</Li>
						<Li>The optional strainer has to be corrosion resistant, easy to remove, sanitary, and waterproof with no possibility of harbouring points</Li>
						<Li>The easy to remove part was implemented in the form of a lock that can be released using a magnetic key</Li>
						<Li>Researched, discussed with university professors and tested multiple metals that must have the following:</Li>
						<ul style="list-style-type:square">
							<Li>High corrosion resistance</Li>
							<Li>Possessed magnetic properties </Li>
							<Li>Capability of machining without special equipment</Li>
							<Li>Easily obtainable and reasonably priced</Li>
						</ul>
						<Li>The types of Stainless steel researched were Austenitic, Martensitic, and Ferritic. Multiple metals that fit the aforementioned list were chosen and tested in salt water to confirm their corrosion resistance capabilities</Li>
						<Li>Conducted numerous tests with variations of the components with the help of prototyping with a 3D printer</Li>
						<Li>A combination of a magnet and a metal that worked together was found</Li>
						<Li>I researched O-ring standards and test fitted different sizes to find an appropriate option for the pin and hole sizes. I later dimensioned the correct grove size based on the standard to get correct sealing</Li>
						<Li>Once a working prototype was achieved, CNC machining service providers were contacted for quotes</Li>
						<Li>Same procedure was followed to design a key for the lock that was easy to manufacture, simple , food safe, and aesthetically pleasing</Li>
						<Li>I outsourced the magnet required for the key from an online vendor and confirmed its capabilities before committing to a large order</Li>

					<!-- DRAIN LOAD TESTING -->
					<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 136, 0)" >DRAIN LOAD TESTING</h2>

					<ul >
						<li>I was involved in conducting multiple tests with different drain products, as the drains must meet load specifications to be used in industrial applications</li>
						<li>I researched and learnt test specifications, out-sourced the testing to a laboratory, designed and manufactured the test specimens, then delivered and witnessed the test procedure when applicable</li>
						<Li>Load specifications follow the DIN EN 1433 classification. Which is called drainage channels for vehicular and pedestrian areas
							classification, design and testing requirements</Li>
						<Li>Load specifications has different levels of classes, the higher the letter number, the greater the load requirement</Li>
						<Li>The drain products were designed to achieve class E or F, which mean it can be used in high wheel loads such as ports, docks and aircraft hangars</Li>
						<Li>The specimen getting tested must be set up according to the target class, which will also dictate the permissible permanent set</Li>
						<Li>The CO (clear opening) distance decides the shape and dimensions of the testing block and the allowed permanent set after applying the load</Li>
						<Li>Inventor stress analysis was used to digitally load test the products as a preliminary litmus test to verify that the physical testing has a higher chance of succeeding. This allowed adding improvements if necessary before hand</Li>
						<Li>After understanding the requirements for performing the testing within the DIN EN 1433, the testing was outsourced to the University of Manitoba Industrial Technology Center</Li>
						<Li>A proposal was written with all the test requirements and a detailed step by step procedure</Li>
						<Li>Test results were studied if specimens couldn't reach the desired class, and modifications were performed to improve the weakest parts</Li>

					<span><img src="images/tabless-gif.webp" ALIGN="right" width = 400px></span>
					
					<ul >
						<li>All slot drains have welded tabs in their slots to maintain the slot width and shape during the transportation and installation process</Li>
						<li>The tabs could be later removed by the client, however, it could be a difficult task to accomplish</Li>
						<li>Tabs create harbouring points, which could be unsanitary. It also creates challenges during the cleaning process</Li>
						<li>To eliminate the need for the tabs, I designed rib like structures to replace them, then I tested them using Inventor stress analysis</Li>
						<Li>Various configurations of the ribs were tested using Inventor's stress analysis with the help of the parametric table tool</Li>
						<Li>The parametric table allows for testing multiple constraints simultaneously to optimize for a specific target</Li>
						<Li>The target was to only allow for a specific amount of displacement at the neck of the slot drain, with the least amount of material required</Li>
						<Li>I chose upper and lower limits to the constraints, then used the the stress analysis study to check every possible combination of the constraints values to find and optimize for the best solution</Li>
						<Li>To decrease the material required to manufacture the ribs, the frame generator feature of Inventor was used. This feature removes material from the ribs that do not contribute to the function of the model as they experience little to no stress</Li>
						<Li>The best rib design was then used in another simulation to find the needed amount of ribs to install on a single slot drain run</Li>
						<Li>I created drawings and DXF files for the sheet metal components to get it ready for production. The ribs were then produced and welded on a slot drain for real life testing</Li>

						<Li>Custom work is time consuming for the engineering department and could take days of work to finish up</Li>
						<Li>Started researching how to use Visual Basic and iLogic to automate some of the custom work Engineering needs to deal with regularly</Li>
						<Li>Used what I learnt to create an automated model that can generate grates with variables that the user can change</Li>
						<Li>The grate model variables include changing its width, length, height, seration, material thickness, etc</Li>
						<Li>The iLogic assembly models required creating multiple parameters in each sub component that used complex equations to calculate the correct placement for all the features</Li>
						<Li>All the components were linked together because locating features in one component must follow the placement of other features in the rest of the components in the assembly</Li>
						<Li>Furthermore, I created linked auto generating drawings that dimensioned all the generated components according to the GD&T standards</Li>
